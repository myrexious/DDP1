# space classes have int or str parameters that determine what happens when a player lands on the space
# later when defining Board class, these different types of space classes are used to create space objects, appended into a list within Board class to create the board

# community chest and chance cards are defined within respective classes
# later when defining Board class, these cards are then created and appended into deck lists within the board class

# finally, player class is defined with parameters indicating the player's current money/property/status
# players methods include buying property, mortgaging property, and buying houses on property


# within Board class, user player (player.user = 1) is created, and computer characters ( "" = 0) are created with for loop given parameter number of players (players)
# with a list of players, a boardlist (the board), and decks for community chest cards and chance cards, I then create methods that run the game within Board class:
#   - playermove: a complicated method at the center of the game that determines what happens when a player lands on a space (both parameters), which can be recursive
#   - playerlose: if a player's money reaches zero at any point in the game, they lose, their assets go to the bank, and they are removed from playerlist and the game
#   - PREMOVE: either generates AI decisions for computer characters before moving, or gives user character options (buyhouse,mortgage,etc.) before moving

# finally, the main function executes a while loop over playerlist that gives each player a PREMOVE and a playermove
# as players lose, they are removed from playerlist
# the whileloop ends when the playerlist is length 1, which prints an endgame message and terminates the file.




# some notes on computer AI:
#   - if computer characters land on a property of the same type (color, utility, or railroad) as something they own, they buy if they have enough money
#   - otherwise, they will purchase new properties 50% of the time (using random)
#   - AI will attempt to get out of jail the moment they have enough recources to get out (50$ or get out of jail free cards), trying for double rolls otherwise
#   - AI will buy houses on monopolies (more valuable monopolies as priority) the moment they have enough money to do so, buying as many as possible
